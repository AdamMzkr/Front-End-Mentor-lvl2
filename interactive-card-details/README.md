### The challenge

This challenge was to build out this Stats preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

Your users should be able to:

Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
