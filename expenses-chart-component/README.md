### The challenge

This challenge was to build out this Stats preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

Your users should be able to:
- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file
