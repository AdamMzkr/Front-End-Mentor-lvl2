### The challenge

This challenge was to build out this Stats preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

Your users should be able to:
- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
